## flask_app_template
Please use this to kickstart your Flask-based application.  

After working on a few personal projects, I found myself often repeating a couple of tasks, which in my opinion could easily be automated. So I decided to write this. Hopefully, I won't procrastinate or abandon this project. And it should get improved over time.  

At the time of this writing (***Tuesday, Sep 8, 2015***), to some extent, I'd still consider myself a Flask newbie even though I learnt the basic part of the framework some months back. Since my knowledge of the framework isn't as extended yet, you shouldn't expect any level of sophistication from this project.  

I welcome contributions and criticisms from "anyone with a good heart".  

I'm also not very proficient with git as yet, so this will take some getting used to.  

If you intend to start using this as it is, here is some quick tips for you:
  + Search for all the lines containing a (or marked as) "TODO" to see what you might need to change.
  + Look for text enclosed in double square brackets and replace them accordingly. For example, where you see:
    [[app_name]]
you should replace the entire text (brackets inclusive) with the name of your flask app instance.
