## flask_app_template
Please use this to kickstart your Flask-based application.  

After working on a few personal projects, I found myself often repeating a couple of tasks, which in my opinion could easily be automated. So I decided to write this. Hopefully, I won't procrastinate or abandon this project. And it should get improved over time.  

At the time of this writing (***Tuesday, Sep 8, 2015***), to some extent, I'd still consider myself a Flask newbie even though I learnt the basic part of the framework some months back. Since my knowledge of the framework isn't as extended yet, you shouldn't expect any level of sophistication from this project.  

I welcome contributions and criticisms from "anyone with a good heart".  

I'm also not very proficient with git as yet, so this will take some getting used to.
